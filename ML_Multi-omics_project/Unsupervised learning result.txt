The unsupervised learning part of this report uses two clustering models, an icluster method clustering and a hierarchical clustering. The metrics used to measure the effectiveness of clustering are PR status, ER status and HER2 status. the quality of clustering is determined by comparing the frequency differences of these metrics. If the above indicators are used as a measure, the quality of clustering by icluster is not satisfactory. icluster is divided into 3 groups, which do not show significant distribution differences in all 3 indicators. Next I used the single omic hierarchical clustering method as an aid to observe the characteristics of icluster's grouping. From the heat map, it can be seen that there is a huge difference between the groupings obtained by hierarchical clustering and those obtained by icluster. From the final results, the grouping results of Gene expression hierarchical clustering showed significant differences in PR status and ER status. copy number mutation showed significant differences in PR status and ER status indicators. somatic mutation showed no significant differences in these three indicators. Protein expression showed significant differences in ER status. Overall, the icluster multi-omics method did not perform well in the above three indicators, and the single omic clustering method produced significant differences in individual indicators.
There may be two reasons for the above results, one is that the design of the metrics measuring the effectiveness of icluster clustering does not reflect the ability of icluster clustering. The second conjecture is due to the fact that single omics clustering exhibits unimpressive results in individual metrics, but affects the final presentation because other omics data play the effect of noise.
